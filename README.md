# Muscle_Tendon_Passive_Parameter_Estimation
To find the muscle properties of the individual we can use MRI images or direct measurements of the cadaver it requires expertise and time. In the other approach, the generic model which is made by cadaver’s data employed and scaled base on the length of participant segments. However, it may not a good representative of subject’s musculoskeletal parameters because muscle properties also depends on the volume of the muscle and etc. In this project I'm trying to develop new method to estimate the passive parameters using optimization algorithm.
